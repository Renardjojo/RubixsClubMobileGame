## Descritpion
Rubik's cube mobile game made with Unity game engine. We can play it on a phone and on pc (we must to change a parameter).
This project is a Rubik's cube. We can move slice of the cube and the whole cube to have all the faces of one color.
We had to use the quaternion to rotate the cube.
